2. Open a terminal (Mac or Linux) or Powershell (Windows). 
3. Navigate to the directory that has the repository
$ cd </path/to/directory>
4. Run the http module as a script from your terminal.
# On Windows, try "py -3 -m http.server" 
$ python3 -m http.server
5. (Optional) By default, this will run the server on localhost’s port 8000. You can change 
the port number if something else is running on 8000 by adding a port number like so: 
$ python3 -m http.server 3000
6. Open a browser (e.g., Chrome) and open http://localhost:8000 and you will be able to see 
the application’s index.html.
